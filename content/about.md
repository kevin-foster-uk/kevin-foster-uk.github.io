I'm a freelance software developer based in Liverpool, England, with 20 years of experience developing software. In my work I aim to focus on maintainability and applying proven software engineering principles.

I value the strength of effective team collaboration. I've learned that the overall quality and cohesion of a team far outweighs the brilliance of any individual contributor. A high-trust environment—where team members feel supported—is essential for building motivated and productive teams.

Outside of client work, I'm exploring new technologies and refining my development practices. I have a particular interest in methodologies that help improve software quality and reliability.

My passion for systems extends beyond code. I'm a music enthusiast and hobbyist producer and easily excited by music technology. I enjoy both listening to and creating music, often exploring the technical and creative challenges of production.
