A fundamental truth about respect is often forgotten. Respect is not a reward to be earned. It is a baseline owed to every person. The real question is not who must earn it, but who, through their actions, shows themselves to be unworthy of it.

This principle is most clearly tested by those in power. Politicians, CEOs, managers, royalty, and the rich often receive respect as an automatic tribute to their status. They come to expect it. But a position or a bank account does not make someone honest, fair, or compassionate. In fact, these roles can expose a lack of character. When a politician lies, a CEO prioritises profit over people, or a manager rules through fear, they actively lose the respect they were initially owed.

We see this dynamic clearly. Supporters may grant figures like Donald Trump or Elon Musk respect based on their power and wealth. Yet, their documented behavior, marked by dishonesty and a lack of compassion, leads many to believe they have forfeited their right to it. Respect becomes a conflict between the position and the person's conduct.

Crucially, this works in reverse. A person without social power—a service worker, a junior employee, or anyone in a marginalized position—deserves the same baseline of respect. Often, they are the ones who consistently demonstrate the attributes that truly affirm its worth, such as integrity and kindness, without any expectation of special treatment. Their worth is proven daily through their actions, not their title.

Therefore, the measure of a person is never their status. When deciding who deserves your respect, ignore the title and look at the behavior. Do they act with fairness and care for others? Or do they simply expect deference?

Respect is a default setting for human interaction. It is maintained or lost through character. It is not a privilege of power, but a reflection of how we treat one another.
