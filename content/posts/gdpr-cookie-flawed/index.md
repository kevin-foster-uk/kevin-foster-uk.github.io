If you’ve visited a website in the past few years, you’ve seen it: the now-ubiquitous cookie consent pop-up. Mandated by the EU’s GDPR and ePrivacy Directive, these banners were designed to give us control over our online data. But years after their introduction, a growing chorus of critics argues that the so-called “cookie law” is a well-intentioned failure.

So, what went wrong?

1. Consent Fatigue Has Won

The most obvious issue is banner fatigue. Instead of thoughtfully considering their privacy choices, most people instinctively hammer the “Accept All” button just to make the pop-up disappear. This has turned a tool meant to empower users into a mere inconvenience they blindly click through, defeating the very purpose of informed consent.

2. A Bad User Experience

Let’s be honest: these pop-ups are annoying. They interrupt reading, clutter beautiful designs, and create a fragmented browsing experience. Some websites, particularly small independent ones, have even chosen to block EU visitors entirely rather than navigate the complex legal maze, reducing access to information and services.

3. A Boon for Big Tech, a Burden for Small Business

Compliance isn’t free. Implementing a compliant consent system requires legal expertise and technical resources. Large corporations can absorb this cost easily, but for small startups and independent publishers, it’s a significant burden. Ironically, a law meant to curb the power of big ad-tech giants has ended up cementing their advantage by creating barriers to entry for smaller competitors.

4. Questionable Privacy Gains

Perhaps the most significant criticism is that the law doesn’t always achieve its primary goal. Many pop-ups use dark patterns—deceptive designs that make rejecting cookies harder than accepting them. Furthermore, determined trackers can find ways to fingerprint users or rely on “legitimate interest” claims, bypassing the need for consent altogether.

5. A Messy, Inconsistent Rollout

The law’s interpretation varies wildly from one EU country to another, creating a legal patchwork that is confusing and costly for any business operating across borders. This lack of harmony undermines the single-market principle and leaves everyone in a state of uncertainty.

Is There a Better Way?

The cookie law correctly identified a real problem: our loss of control over personal data online. But its execution is flawed. Many experts now believe a more effective solution would be to shift the responsibility away from endless pop-ups and toward browser-level settings and default bans on intrusive third-party tracking.

The conversation has started to move in this direction. The focus is slowly shifting from asking users to constantly make complex choices to instead building a web where privacy is the default, not an option buried in a pop-up.

The cookie consent banner has become a symbol of our growing concern for digital privacy. It’s a shame it has also become a symbol of how not to do it.
