            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <img id="thumb" src="kevin-thumb.jpg" alt=""/>
            <p>I'm a freelance software developer based in Liverpool, England, with over 20 years of experience delivering bespoke software solutions. I specialise in building custom applications tailored to meet specific business needs.</p>
            <p>My work is driven by a strong focus on quality, clarity, and long-term maintainability. I take pride in writing clean, well-structured code and applying proven software engineering principles to every project.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I've come to deeply value the strength of effective team collaboration. I've learned that the overall quality and cohesion of a team far outweigh the brilliance of any individual contributor. A high-trust environment—where team members feel supported by each other and by management—is essential for building motivated, focused, and productive teams. This belief strongly influences how I approach both solo and collaborative projects.</p>
            <p>Outside of client work, I'm constantly exploring new technologies and refining my development practices. I have a particular interest in object-oriented programming and methodologies that help improve software quality and reliability.</p>

                <h4>Alen Bubich</h4>
                <h5>Co-Founder, CityBlast Media Inc.</h5>
                <p>If you're looking for a programmer who cares about the quality of his code and more importantly cares about your business,
                Kevin is your guy. He has a deep understanding of object oriented programming, server management,
                development "hygiene" (version control, bug tracking, continuous integration, etc) and general web development
                at large (CDN's, SSL, cloud computing, web hosting, database management, etc.) </p>
                <p>Kevin is exceptional when it comes to attention to detail.
                His code is virtually bug-free and he was always the first guy I would send in to find errors with the other programmers’ code. </p>
                <p>Reliable, responsible and engaged, as a programmer and an employee, I would recommend Kevin for any role without
                hesitation and without reservation. </p>
                <p>He was an asset to our company and doubtlessly will be one to yours too. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="exp">
                <h4>Carly Jayne Crowder</h4>
                <h5>General Manager, Dolphin Music</h5>
                <p>Kevin came into Dolphin Music in 2011 as a Web Developer and was able to quickly and confidently pick up a series of intricate systems with ease.
                He was was able to work on numerous business critical activities and produce significant results in a short space of time.
                He is passionate about detailed documentation and I would commend his ability to prioritise (through some lovely lists!).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="exp">
                <h4>Michael Helm</h4>
                <h5>I.T. Director, iknow-uk Ltd</h5>
                <p>I can definitely recommend Kevin, he is an excellent PHP developer and always worked well with the team here. He was a proponent of a proper version control system, which we have embraced and continue to roll out even after he left us. Kevin works well and to a very high standard in all aspect of programming.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="exp">
                <h4>Geoffrey Hoffman</h4>
                <h5>Salient Digital, inc.</h5>
                <p>On numerous occasions, Kevin Foster has helped my clients and my projects grow faster and with more finesse than they would have without his involvement.</p>
                <p>Kevin's rich understanding of online software development, using multiple programming languages and techniques, combined with his exceptional attention to detail while providing easy-to-read reusable code have made Kevin an integral part of multiple successful projects over the past several years.</p>
                <p>When given a task, Kevin is courageous and honest enough to recommend an even better solution than you originally proposed to him, and then he implements it sooner than you expected. In fifteen years of developing software platforms, working with hundreds of different programmers and designers, I can tell you it is rare you will have the good fortune of working with someone as skilled and productive as Kevin T. Foster.</p>
                <p>Whenever I have the chance to bid on a project bigger than myself, he's without question one of the first people I think of to get involved.</p>
